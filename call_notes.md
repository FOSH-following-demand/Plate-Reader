### Call notes

Call on 04/06/2019
Note taker: Andre 

- funds only arrived friday prior to call. 
- things are not on github because they were waiting for parts to arrive, 
  - team will work on documenting things, even if parts are not there yet
  - also will create a table with an overview of existing projects. Shortcomings and benefits. This will allow people to 
  see right away why things are being done in a certain manner.
  
- question: What kind of system should be used for making the box/enclosure for the system? local parts or something that 
can be bought off the shelf anywhere (eg aluminum profiles).

 For next week:
  - documentation on github!!.
  - start building.
